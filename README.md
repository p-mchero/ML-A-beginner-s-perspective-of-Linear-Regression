# Linear regression as an ML beginner.
I just finished learning about linear regression in machine learning.
I have decided to represent my understanding using codes.

## The Data I used
I created my own dataset by relating two features to a third using a simple mathematical equation.
The dataset consist of 15 training examples.
I used this as a practice dataset for my linear regression.
